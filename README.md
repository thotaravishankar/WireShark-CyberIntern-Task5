# Task 5: Capture and Analyze Network Traffic Using Wireshark

##  Objective
Capture live network packets and identify basic protocols and traffic types using Wireshark.

##  Tools Used
- Wireshark (latest version)
- Operating System: Windows 11

##  Steps Performed
1. Installed Wireshark.
2. Started packet capture on active network interface.
3. Generated traffic by browsing websites and using ping command.
4. Stopped capture after 1 minute.
5. Applied filters (HTTP, DNS, TCP, etc.).
6. Identified multiple protocols in the captured data.
7. Exported capture as `.pcap` file.

## ðŸ“¡ Protocols Identified
- **HTTP** â€“ Used for web communication (port 80/443).
- **DNS** â€“ Used for domain name resolution (port 53).
- **TCP** â€“ Connection-oriented traffic management.
- **ICMP** â€“ Used for ping requests (if captured).
  


##  Summary of Findings
- Successfully captured and analyzed live traffic.
- Observed communication across multiple protocols.
- Gained hands-on experience in using Wireshark for traffic analysis.
